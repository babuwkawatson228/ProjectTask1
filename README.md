# ProjectTask1
Task1 for a Java using Spring Boot, Student Yaroslav Pilhui (SID: 77158, group 2)

In the following repository, you will find my solution for the 1st task for the project.

Overall, our programs in the browser, we are looking at 2 core pages:

1. Home page: http://localhost:8080 (Screenshot 1)
2. Greeting page: http://localhost:8080/greeting (Screenshot 2)

And we also may see, how the text of Greeting page is changing when we are changing our link as follows:

http://localhost:8080/greeting?name=VISTULA (Screenshot 3)

http://localhost:8080/greeting?name=testXXX (Screensoht 4)
